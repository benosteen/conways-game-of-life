Conway's Game of Life
=====================

An ultra-lightweight implementation of Conway's game of life, including a visualizer.

Edit the inputs in `main.py` and then run it. `conway.py` will run the actual
game, and `visualization.py` will draw the cells on a centered grid.

The visualization requires the PIL Python library, which can be installed via pip.
